# Script Descriptions

## Script 022.py:

The Python script `022.py` generates a complex array consisting of 1024 points that represent a sine waveform.

## Script 023.py:

The script `023.py` converts the complex array from a hexadecimal format to a float format that ranges from -1 to 1. The resulting complex array is also of size 1024.

## Script 024.py:

Finally, the script `024.py` converts the output from `023.py` to a format that can be imported into a MATLAB program. The resulting output is saved to a text file named `024output.txt`.
